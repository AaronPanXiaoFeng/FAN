# Offical repo for "FAN: Fatigue-Aware Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction in E-commerce Recommendation"

Due to the commercial sensitivity of promotions, releasing our datasets and features is not applicable.

The implementation of our proposed method is based on our company-customized distributed 
Tensorflow framework for better industrial applications. Releasing code related to the 
framework is not allowed and detailed information about input features are also confidential. 
So with these information removed, the main source code is extracted as supplementary 
materials. The released source code is not runnable but able to illustrate the implementation of 
model structure.
